# MinDeletionSize

Runtime and Space Analysis:
- minDeletionSize : Runtime = O(n^2) because there is a double for loop that can run at most n^2 times
                    Space = O(1) only four variables are initialized within each of the for loops and one boolean is initialized
- main : Runtime = O(n^2) because only two other lines of code are executed besides minDeletionSize()
         Space = O(1) because only two vatiables are initialized
